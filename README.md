## Description

This project is an **Angular App** developed to consume [API Cuak](https://github.com/Omar-Pecos/api-graphql-cuak-prod) and use all characteristics of GraphQL APIs **(queries,mutations and subscriptions)**.The API has **authorization** and **authentication** with **JWT** (Json Web Tokens) implemented.

It uses **apollo-angular** module to perform queries and mutations,and to set listeners for subscriptions and **sweetalert** for displaying some CRUD notifications.

The original idea is create an social network similar to Twitter but more focused in images. When a user creates a post, it must have a random image loaded from [Unplash](https://unsplash.com/) or a file uploaded by the user.
In the app the users can create posts, like or unlike them,reply to posts,join global chat rooms, create private chat rooms with other users, and it has real time chat and notifications inside the app.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Maybe you have to wait a bit to the API to come online because it is using [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) free service and the projects are 'asleep' until they get a request.

You can try to register as a new user or log in with this data : 

>>User : **user**

>>Password : **user**
